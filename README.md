  Brief introduction: Hi I'm programming since summer of 2019 I value understading of most fundamental aspects of pc architecture and coding therefore I'm not
 afraid of using debugger or write low level things. If its about libraries When something is not working by my mind I'm likely to change code on my own. 
 I think the essence of entire programming is connecting hardware with code and i think best languages are 1-Assembly 2-C 3-C++. So far i know  basics of
 python, assembly, and web stack i know cpp and java  on average level. I dont think im good  cuz I would need to develop this languages to say it.
